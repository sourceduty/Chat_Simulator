Bucket Brigade Network Concept

A linear bucket brigade network is a concept often used in production and logistics systems, where workers pass tasks or items down a line, with each worker handling one specific portion of the task before passing it on to the next. When applied to conveying ideas, the concept can be adapted to represent a sequence of individuals or teams, where each person or team contributes to the development or refinement of an idea before passing it along to the next person or team in the sequence.
